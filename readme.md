Simple Chatty Bot

This is a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and methods in order to get used to the basic syntax of Java.

This program represents a bot which has some functions like: introduce the name of the bot, ask username and guess their age by calculating user's input and ask users a question until they get a correct answer.

By making this program, I have learned about fundamental Java concepts, learn about Java data types and how can we use them.Additionally, I also have a chance to learn about conditionals and control flow in Java programs. Last but not least, I have learned about the usage of the loop in order to iterate through lists and repeat code. What a great experience!
